# Osse-Broadcast

## ARCHIVED

> This repo was archived as the project now lives in the osse repo.

This is the SSE server for the Osse music server.

Osse is written in PHP. This works great for requests, but not so great for long lived connections.

This server is in go, highly concurrent, and much lighter than the Laravel Reverb implementation.
